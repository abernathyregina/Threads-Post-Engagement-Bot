## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” Users select their Threads accounts, engagement type (like/comment/reply), and target posts from the Appilot dashboard.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” The system uses UI Automator or Appium to navigate Threads, perform actions (scroll, tap, type), and validate success.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” Likes, comments, and replies are executed, with engagement logs returned to the dashboard.  
4. **Other Functionalities** â€” Features such as retry logic, randomized delays, and proxy rotation ensure seamless and undetectable operation.
